The team members for ERC are:

# [Rein Houben](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/houben.rein)
Rein has worked on TB for over a decade in various ways, including running TB field studies in North Malawi for 3 years. As a TB epidemiologist he looks to apply modelling methods to address the TBornotTB objectives of better understanding the natural history of TB, which will help improve TB policy decisions down the line. He is also the co-head of the LSHTM TB modelling group (https://tbmodelling.lshtm.ac.uk/). 

# [Jon Emery](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/emery.jon)
Jon is a mathematical modeller with an interest in the natural history of tuberculosis. With research experience in theoretical physics and whole energy systems, Jon focusses on encapsulating advances in our understanding of tuberculosis natural history within mathematical models to better understand the epidemiology of the disease and in turn support policy development.

# Alexandra Richards
![Alex](../images/Alex-profile.jpeg){:height="72px" width ="72px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Alex is a third year research degree student with an interest in modelling the natural history of tuberculosis with a focus on subclinical disease. Her background is in maths, physics, and epidemiology.

# [Katherine Horton](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/horton.katherine)
Katherine is an epidemiologist and mathematical modeller whose current work focuses on the potential and impact of new insights on the natural history of TB. She is also the LSHTM Programme Team Leader and Cross-Consortium Modelling Lead for the LIGHT Consortium, an FCDO-funded research consortium working to better understand and address gender disparities in TB burden and care in sub-Saharan Africa.

# [Nabila Shaikh](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/shaikh.nabila)
Nabila has extensive experience with TB research and policy, and is supporting a range of projects across the TBornotTB project. 

# [Nicola Foster](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/foster.nicola)
Nicola is a health economist with experience in TB. She is analysing the impact of socio-economic changes on the burden of TB, to help inform our natural history models.
