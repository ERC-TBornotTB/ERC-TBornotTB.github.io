The team members for ERC are:

# [Rein Houben](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/houben.rein)
Rein is a TB epidemiologist who applies modelling methods to address questions on latent TB infection and social determinants of TB, as well as to inform TB policy decisions. He also leads the development and implementation of TIME.

# [Jon Emery](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/emery.jon)
Jon is a mathematical modeller with an interest in the natural history of tuberculosis. With research experience in theoretical physics and whole energy systems, Jon focusses on encapsulating advances in our understanding of tuberculosis natural history within mathematical models to better understand the epidemiology of the disease and in turn support policy development.

# Alexandra Richards
![Alex](../images/Alex-profile.jpeg){:height="72px" width ="72px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Alex is a third year research degree student with an interest in modelling the natural history of tuberculosis with a focus on subclinical disease. Her background is in maths, physics, and epidemiology.

# [Katherine Horton](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/horton.katherine)
Katherine is an epidemiologist and mathematical modeller whose current work focuses on the potential and impact of new insights on the natural history of TB. She is also the LSHTM Programme Team Leader and Cross-Consortium Modelling Lead for the LIGHT Consortium, an FCDO-funded research consortium working to better understand and address gender disparities in TB burden and care in sub-Saharan Africa.

# [Nabila Shaikh](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/shaikh.nabila)
Nabila works primarily with the TIME Model. With an MSc in Control of Infectious Diseases from LSHTM, she is currently working to conduct an impact evaluation for the TIME model to understand how the project facilitates and impacts national and subnational TB policy. Nabila also works to support the National TB Programs of Ethiopia and Nigeria to model interventions in preparation for National Strategic Plans and grant applications.

# [Nicola Foster](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/foster.nicola)
