The team members for this project are:

# [Rein Houben](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/houben.rein)
![Rein](../images/Rein-profile.jpg){:height="60px" width ="60px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Rein has worked on TB for over a decade in various ways, including running TB field studies in North Malawi for 3 years. As a TB epidemiologist he looks to apply modelling methods to address the TBornotTB objectives of better understanding the natural history of TB, which will help improve TB policy decisions down the line. He is also the co-head of the [LSHTM TB modelling group](https://tbmodelling.lshtm.ac.uk/). Rein was the Principal Investigator of the TBornotTB project, and can be contacted through [Rein.Houben@lshtm.ac.uk](rein.houben@lshtm.ac.uk). 

# [Jon Emery](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/emery.jon)
![Jon](../images/Jon-profile.jpg){:height="60px" width ="60px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Jon was a research fellow at LSHTM with an interest in the natural history of tuberculosis. With research experience in theoretical physics and whole energy systems, Jon focussed on encapsulating advances in our understanding of tuberculosis natural history within mathematical models to better understand the epidemiology of the disease and in turn support policy development.

# [Alexandra Richards](http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/richards.alexandra)
![Alex](../images/Alex-profile.jpeg){:height="60px" width ="60px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Alex is a research fellow at LSHTM. She completed her PhD in modelling the natural history of tuberculosis with a focus on subclinical disease. Her work now focusses on modelling TB to understand and address gender disparities in TB burden and care.

# [Katherine Horton](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/horton.katherine)
![Katherine](../images/Katherine-profile.jpg){:height="60px" width ="60px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Katherine is an epidemiologist and mathematical modeller whose current work focuses on the potential and impact of new insights on the natural history of TB. She is also the LSHTM Programme Team Leader and Cross-Consortium Modelling Lead for the LIGHT Consortium, an FCDO-funded research consortium working to better understand and address gender disparities in TB burden and care in sub-Saharan Africa.

# [Nicola Foster](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/foster.nicola)
![Nicola](../images/Nicola-profile.jpg){:height="60px" width ="60px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Nicola has a background in public health and health economics. She has experience in designing and implementing mathematical models of patient pathways through TB diagnosis and treatment. Her current work includes the analysis of socio-economic changes in the burden of TB.  

# [Alvaro Schwalb](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/schwalb.alvaro)
![Alvaro](../images/Alvaro-profile.jpg){:height="60px" width ="60px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Alvaro is a research fellow and research degree student at LSHTM working on re-evaluating epidemiological metrics of tuberculosis burden. His background is in medicine and epidemiology

# Nabila Shaikh
![Nabila](../images/Nabila-profile.png){:height="60px" width ="60px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Nabila was a research assistant at LSHTM, working on supporting TB programmes making policy decisions, and exploring the role of non-symptomatic transmission of pathogens. 

# Ty McCaffrey
![Ty](../images/ty.jpg){:height="60px" width ="60px" style="float: left; padding-right:10px" class="img-responsive"}
Ty was a research assistant at LSHTM, focussing on the implications of different disease pathways on the potential impact of current TB care and prevention policies.
